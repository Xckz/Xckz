- 👋 Hi, I’m Lyman Connor(@Xckz). I've lived in NoVA for over 7 years and bartend when I'm not coding.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, working out, and making food. I listen to a variety of electronic music and actually produce some as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node & JS with a strong grasp on HTML/CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects with willing teammates. I think working on projects that are sound/music related would be amazing.
